# OnlineExaminationSystem
The online examination system is a software solution that allows an institute to organize,  perform and conduct tests online. This can be done via the Internet. Without going to the  exam centre, the student can write exams. Paper and pen are not necessary. This project helps  to create various mock exams for students.
